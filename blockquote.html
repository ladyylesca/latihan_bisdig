    <h1>Reason</h1>
    <p>The reason I choose online instead offline socializing,</p>
    <blockquote>
        I have bad experience in past, even more when I was a little get bullied by my senior. Throught time everything I do to social people only gave me more anxious to interact with people. Scared of rejection, scared getting used again, and etc. I get more comfortable when it come to online people instead. I can interact with them without worry about what they think too sometimes and just enjoy my time with them.
